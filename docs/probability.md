# Probability Theory

Here you'll learn all about Probability Theory in a practical manner

## Aximoatic Theory

### Definitions

#### Random Experiment
* It's a process or an outcome that is not deterministic, i.e. it is stoichastic
* e.g. $f(x) = x^{2}$ <br>
    - or fixed input => fixed output, meaning deterministic
* e.g. 
    - Roll a die (6 possibilities)
    - dealing a deck of cards (52! permutations)

#### Sample Space
* A set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, typically denoted by S or $\OMEGA$

#### Elements or Outcomes (or Atoms or Singletons)
* These are the outcomes. Usually denoted by small 's' or $\omega$
* e.g. Flip a coin 3 times (order matters), will have these outcomes or elements:
    - HHH, HHT, HTH, HHT, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT
* and set1 = {HHH, HHT, HTH} or set2 = {THH, TTH, TTT} or set3 = {TTT} are the events
* Above entire set of possible outcomes is called a Descrete Random Experiment
