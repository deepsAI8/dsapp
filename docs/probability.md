## Aximoatic Theory

### Definitions

* Random Experiment
    - It's a process or an outcome that is not deterministic, i.e. it is stoichastic
    - e.g. $$f(x) = x^{2}$$ <br>

    or fixed input => fixed output, meaning deterministic
    - e.g. 
        - Roll a die (6 possibilities)
        - dealing a deck of cards (52! permutations)

    - just an example of tex
        - $p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$, \(p(x|y) = \frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}\).
